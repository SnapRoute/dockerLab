## Introduction

Snaproute dockerLab allows you to quicky and easily deploy switches 
running FlexSwitch within a virtual environment.

Use this tool to familiarize yourself with SnapRoute Flexswitch along
with testing custom topologies specific to your network!

## Easy Setup

Setup your SnapRoute dockerLab environment with a single command:

```bash

root@ubuntu:~/$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnapRoute/dockerLab/master/bash/install.sh | sh

```

If using a clean install - it may be necessary to install curl, if an error message like this is seen:

```bash
The program 'curl' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install curl
```
To continue, follow the instructions from the target distro (apt, yum, etc.) to install curl:

```bash
root@ubuntu:~/$ sudo apt install curl
[sudo] password for ubuntu: 
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  curl
...
``` Â   

### Docker Privileges

You may want to add users to the docker group so they can execute docker 
commands without root access.  

```bash
user1@ubuntu:~/$ sudo usermod -aG docker user1

# Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!
```

## Manual Setup

The SnapRoute docker lab is dependent on a Linux kernel locally running docker 
service and python 2.7. Additionally, it's useful to have git installed to 
pull fresh lab modules.

Use apt-get, yum, or pkg to install
* docker
* python2.7
* git

Finally, pull the public repository via git clone command.  For example:

```bash
# install git and python
root@ubuntu:~/$ apt-get update && apt-get install -y git python

# install docker via get.docker.com script
root@ubuntu:~/$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
root@ubuntu:~/$ service docker start
# (optional) add a username to docker group
root@ubuntu:~/$ usermod -aG docker user1

# git clone to pull dockerLab scripts
root@ubuntu:~/$ git clone https://github.com/SnapRoute/dockerLab.git
root@ubuntu:~/$ python dockerLab/labtool.py --help

```

## Usage

Once docker is installed, you can execute  **labtool.py** to spin up containers
running SnapRoute Flexswitch.  

### Available Labs:
* [Lab1: Introduction to Flexswitch](./labs/lab1/README.md)
* [MyClosNetwork: Custom Networks](./labs/myClosNetwork/README.md)

```bash

root@ubuntu:~/$ python dockerLab/labtool.py --help
usage: labtool.py [-h] [--describe] [--lab LAB] [--stage STAGE] [--cleanup]
                  [--repair] [--debug {debug,warn,info,error}]

SnapRoute LabTool

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --describe            Describe/List currently available labs
  --lab LAB             Specify which dockerized SnapRoute lab to build. For a
                        list of available labs and descriptions, use
                        --describe option
  --stage STAGE         Each lab may have one or more stages with various
                        configurations/ verifications to perform. Specify a
                        stage option will auto-reconfigure all devices with
                        necessary configuration required at the end of the
                        stage. This is a useful operation for users who need
                        help completing and or wish to skip over stages. Note,
                        this operation will rebuild the entire container so
                        any custom configuration will be lost.
  --cleanup             clean/delete all containers referenced within lab
                        topology
  --repair              This script builds linux vEth interfaces and assigns
                        them directly to the docker container to create the
                        point-to-point links. If a container is reloaded, the
                        vEth interface references become invalid and need to
                        be rebuilt. Use the --repair option to repair broken
                        topology links.
  --debug {debug,warn,info,error}
